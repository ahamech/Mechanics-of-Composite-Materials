# Mechanics of Composite Materials

A MATLAB-based repository focused on laminated composite analysis using classical lamination theory and failure criteria such as Tsai-Wu.

Includes tools for stiffness matrix computation (A, B, D), stress-strain transformation, and safety evaluation of fiber-reinforced structures. Currently features a shaft design project based on Autar K. Kaw's formulations.
